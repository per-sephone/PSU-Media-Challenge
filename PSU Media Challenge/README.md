Thanks for checking out my PSU media challenge!!

I made this page using primarily html, css, some bootstrap and a little
javascript. I utilized bootstrap's carousel to showcase the 3 student
media groups that I chose. I found the images on a free photo stock
website. I also moved the text descriptions below the image to help
with accessibility. (Default is on the image in bootstrap). Each image
clicks through to that group's webpage. I also looked up the hex codes
for PSU's color palates and used those. I found some cute free fonts
online as well, making sure they are fairly legible. For the RSVP button
I used javascript to create a little pop up where the user can enter
their email address to confirm their RSVP. I did experiment with jQuery
for a pop up form, but was not happy with the result. For the design I like
to keep things pretty simple, but still organized in a way that is easy
for the user to navigate. I also added a simple footer that ties the 
page's color scheme together. Lastly, if I were to host this page, I would
either use github which has a very simple process for hosting a web page
or digital ocean, which is equally pretty simple to set up and both are
free!
